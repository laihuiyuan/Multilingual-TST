# [Multilingual Pre-training with Language and Task Adaptation for Multilingual Text Style Transfer (ACL 2022)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08552)

## Overview

![](./fig/overview.png)
In view of the general scarcity of parallel data, we propose a modular approach for multilingual 
formality transfer, which consists of two training strategies that target adaptation to both language and task. 
Our approach achieves competitive performance without monolingual task-specific parallel data and can be applied 
to other style transfer tasks as well as to other languages.

## Dataset
- [XFORMAL](https://github.com/Elbria/xformal-FoST): informal text (0) <-> formal text (1), e.g. train.0 <-> train.1.
- [News-crawl](http://data.statmt.org/news-crawl/): Language-specific generic non-parallel data.

## Quick Start
### Step 1: Language Adaptation Training
```bash
# en_XX, it_IT, fr_XX, pt_XX
python train_lang_adap.py -dataset news-crawl -lang en_XX
```

### Step 2: Task Adaptation Training
```bash
# en_XX, it_IT, fr_XX, pt_XX
python train_task_adap.py -dataset xformal -lang en_XX
```

### Step 3: Inference

```bash
# ADAPT + EN data (it_IT, fr_XX, pt_XX)
python infer_en_data.py -dataset xformal -lang it_IT -style 0 

# ADAPT + EN cross-attn (it_IT, fr_XX, pt_XX)
python infer_en_attn.py -dataset xformal -lang it_IT -style 0    
```
